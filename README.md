I'm a third-year IT student at EPITECH Toulouse (France),  
Currently navigating between lines of code, rough nights, and too much coffee.  
Here, you’ll find a selection of the projects I've built throughout my studies — from school assignments to personal experiments (some successful… some educational 😄).

💡 If you're here looking for solutions, remember: copying is not learning — and at EPITECH, cheating can cost you your year. Use this code responsibly.
